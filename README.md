# Case Study 3: Palmoria Group – HR Analytics

## Company Overview

Palmoria Group is a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, currently facing public criticism over perceived gender inequality within its workforce. Amid plans to expand locally and internationally, the leadership is keen to investigate potential issues like gender bias, unequal pay, and compliance failures before they escalate.

As an HR Analytics Consultant, I was tasked by CHRO Mr. Shofoluwe to analyze employee data and provide actionable insights. A secondary request came from Mr. Gamma to compute bonus allocations based on employee performance.
